# Procedures

How can we operate effectively as the reproducibility working group?

## Use the Project Board

Hackathon active projects are being managed in two main places:

 * [BONSAMURAIS project board](https://github.com/orgs/BONSAMURAIS/projects/2)
 * [BONSAI.uno live stream](https://hackathon.bonsai.uno/event/1)

It is not clear which of these is more "primary", but these resources can be used to identify which projects are in progress and generating deliverables.

We will tentatively adopt the following procedure for identifying projects:

On the **project board**, everything to the *right* of "Concept-building" should be tracked by the reproducibility working group.  At this point (2019-03-25-11:01 (GMT-0700)) there are 8 projects, including 5 "in progress", 2 "stalled", and 1 "completed."  Each of these should have an entry in the [working groups status page](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/hackathon-2019/blob/master/working-groups.md) and it seems likely this group will be responsible for maintaining that page.

### Completed deliverables

For each project in the "completed deliverables" column we should be able to work with the project lead to identify the inputs, outputs, and workflows for each project. These form the main work area for this group.
