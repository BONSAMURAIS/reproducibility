Tasks
--
--

Chris:
- incomplete set of guidelines
- hard to turn generals into specifics
  = especially if we move away from "LCI datasets" to something that is more complex
  = no need of perfect answer right now
  = comments + review

Deliverables:

 * Before hackathon

   - "loose guidelines" for how groups should express their inputs + outputs + methods
   - daily objectives for github repo mgmt


 * During

   - keep tabs on groups' repo activity

 * After



We do have cmplex models used to build databases e.g. ecoinvent
 - complex model for clinker production
 - refinery operation
 = nobody ahs seen thhe model but it is there
 - landfilling

commissioned by 1 person
/
jungbluth
doka

ecoinvent asked for input

nobody published anything

strong unique personalities ==> unique value choices in thhe way models are built

we don't want ppl to be surprised
complex without complicated

PSI group on "future cars" can produce LCI
/airplanes
/motorcycles

make available + used

something that we also struggle with
try different things + build a collective knowledge base
don't be prescriptive

report failures + problems

future cars: in jupyter notebooks
- physics model
- driving cycle
- train the model
- real world data
- db of production cars: engine size, drag coef, rolling friction
= guesses for material compositions
--> excel sheet with a set of db inventories
*unit processes*
nomenclature in ecoinvent

correspondence tables: translation from nomenclature to database reference can be done automatically

describe how they fit together without prescribing how they work

# working groups

 - PRe - Rutger - his job is to come up with a better spec for the SimaPro csv format

 - ontology + vocabulary - lists for products, lists for industry;
   * lists for units is contentious
   iterate on wk saying "can we come up with a fundamental ontology"---------
   activity, product, AGENT <- actor responsible for that product
   biggest, most active
   before the hackathon: come up with the first model

 - sw devel group: skeleton for how to build a python library where I get Unit test/ doco/ CI etc built in

 - reproducibility

 - bentso -- using ENTSO/E electricity network operator
   provides historical data--> now hourly from everyone in EU
   3 years is the most we can reliably say

   misses uncertainty
   misses interaction effects


EXIOBASE - foundation database -> will be converted into the ontology
"changing their product names to our product names"
standard industry names
ISIC codes don't distinguish between

WIOD - CH based - all economists and lawyers
many fewer flows

smaller deliverables - e.g. one person team

different models, some simple, some more complex

Carlos
 - testing -- python --- what is the object
 - also in bentso- can understand how to use the API

Tom
 - https://mybinder.org
 - connecting our ideas specific to LCA to the wider repro-of-science tools
 - reluctant to take tasks before start
 - during is ok

Chris
 = list of tasks - pick one
